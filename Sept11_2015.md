# Redline Research Meeting Notes, Sept 11, 2015 
# What have we have done?
- Python translator from Elephant Tracks -> datalog
# What do we need?
- convert iris to something we can run through command line
  - maven
  - ant
  - gradle
- consider clojure dsl
- build knowledge base <-> formulate queries
  - interactive query mode
# What we want to do / What research questions are we persuing?
- Discover invariants to build pointAt relationships and ask questions like "throughout the execution of the prog..."
  - "do objs of type a always point to objs of type b"
  - "which types have a unique incoming reference"
    - if an object a is allocated, something points to object a and nothing else ever points to object a

# Concerns
- parsing out unneeded parts of the elephant tracks trace
  - before or after converting to datalog
